recipe.html is a smalll recipe site I designed to look like a menu page you would see at a resturant. 
I added a small photo to showcase part of this and a video for your convenience.


Recipe.html was written in html & css.
The css is mostly contained in the head sectoin.
the footer contains a small signuature.

Thank you, enjoy.
